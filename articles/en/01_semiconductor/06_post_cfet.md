# 【Semiconductor:06】🚀 Post-CFET  
### — The Outlook for Next-Generation Transistors Toward 2040
topics: ["Semiconductor", "CFET", "Post-CMOS", "Device Roadmap"]

## 🧭 Introduction

We have traced the evolution from planar MOSFETs  
through FinFETs, GAA, and ultimately CFETs.

At this point, a natural question arises:

> **Where do we go after CFET?**

This article does not claim a single definitive answer.  
Instead, it organizes the **realistic options and constraints envisioned up to around 2040**,  
from the perspectives of device physics and manufacturing feasibility.

## 🧩 CFET Is Not the End, but It Is a Milestone

CFET attempts to address, at the structural level and simultaneously:

- The completion of electric-field control (GAA)  
- Extreme area efficiency via vertical stacking  
- Integration with power delivery separation (BPR)  

These represent the major challenges CMOS has faced for decades.

At the same time, CFET inevitably introduces:

- Strong thermal coupling  
- Severe process temperature constraints  
- Rapidly increasing interconnect and manufacturing costs  

In this sense, CFET is best positioned as:

> **Not the “end” of CMOS structural evolution,  
> but a clear and significant milestone**

## ⏳ Up to ~2030: Extending and Stabilizing CFET

Up to around 2030, the central theme will be:

> **How to keep CFET viable and manufacturable**

Key focus areas include:

- Full-scale deployment of BPR (Backside Power Rail)  
- Re-architecting interconnect hierarchies and power networks  
- Advanced thermal management and packaging technologies  

In this phase, value lies less in:

- Introducing entirely new transistor structures  
and more in  
- **Preventing existing structures from breaking down**

## 🔗 2030–2035: Heterogeneous Integration Becomes Decisive

During this period, improvements to a single transistor structure alone  
will no longer be sufficient to meet system-level demands.

Technologies moving to the forefront include:

- Chiplets  
- Advanced 3D integration  
- Monolithic 3D (logic–logic / logic–memory)  

Here, performance is determined less by:

> **“What device you use”**  
and more by  
> **“How you combine them”**

## 🌱 2035–2040: Beyond-CMOS Technologies Coexist in Niche Roles

Beyond 2035, several **non-CMOS technologies** gain practical relevance:

- 2D materials (e.g., MoS₂)  
- Spintronics  
- Quantum devices  

The key point, however, is that these technologies are unlikely to:

- Replace general-purpose logic  
but rather  
- **Coexist by complementing CMOS in specific, limited applications**

CMOS will likely remain:

> **The most manufacturable and design-friendly foundational technology**

## 🎯 “What Works” Matters More Than “What’s New”

When discussing Post-CFET, the most important criteria are not:

- Novelty  
- Theoretical performance limits  

Instead, the decisive questions are:

- Can it be manufactured?  
- Can it be designed?  
- Can it be modeled?  
- Can it be integrated into education and EDA flows?  

These are the same criteria that governed every transition:

> Planar → FinFET → GAA → CFET

## 📝 Summary

- ✅ CFET marks a major milestone in CMOS structural evolution  
- ✅ Up to ~2030 focuses on extending and stabilizing CFET  
- ✅ The 2030s are dominated by heterogeneous integration  
- ✅ Toward 2040, beyond-CMOS technologies coexist in niche roles  
- ✅ The essence of Post-CFET lies in **feasibility, not novelty**  

The Post-CFET era can be described as:

> **Not a time to search for the next shape,  
> but a time to ask how far we can make things truly work**

This question will continue to confront  
design, manufacturing, and education alike.
