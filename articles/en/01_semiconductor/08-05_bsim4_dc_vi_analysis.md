# 【Semiconductor】 📈  08-05.  Reading MOSFET DC Characteristics with BSIM4 — Vg–Id / Vd–Id Analysis
topics: ["Semiconductor", "BSIM4", "SPICE", "DC Analysis", "MOSFET"]

---

## 🧭 Introduction

In the previous article, we covered **BSIM4 model generation using Paramus**.  
Once a model card is created, there is one essential next step:

> **Verify what kind of V–I characteristics the model actually exhibits.**

In this article, we use **DC analysis** with a BSIM4 MOSFET model to visualize:

- Gate voltage sweep: $V_g$ – $I_d$ characteristics  
- Drain voltage sweep: $V_d$ – $I_d$ characteristics  

Through these plots, we organize the **basic MOSFET operation** and the  
**physical meaning of model parameters**.

## 🔍 What Is DC Analysis?

DC analysis evaluates the **steady-state voltage–current (V–I) relationship**,  
ignoring time-dependent effects.

For MOSFETs, the two most important DC characteristics are:

- **$V_g$ – $I_d$ (transfer characteristics)**
- **$V_d$ – $I_d$ (output characteristics)**

These characteristics are the starting point for:

- Device understanding  
- Model validation  
- Circuit design and evaluation  

They are the **most fundamental and essential characteristics**.

## 🧰 Analysis Environment (SemiDevKit)

In this article, we use the **BSIM4 DC Analyzer** included in **SemiDevKit**.

🔗 Tool Page  
[BSIM4_ANALYZER_DC | SemiDevKit](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/SemiDevKit/bsim/bsim4_analyzer_dc/)

- **Automated DC analysis** using BSIM4 × ngspice × Python
- NMOS / PMOS (130 nm) support
- Automatic plotting of $V_g$–$I_d$ and $V_d$–$I_d$
- **Automatic extraction of $V_t$, $g_{m,\max}$, $I_{d,\mathrm{lin}}$, $I_{d,\mathrm{sat}}$**
- Designed for education, with a view toward **future commercial-grade analysis tools**

### Prerequisites

- BSIM4 model card (generated by Paramus)
- ngspice
- Python 3.10 or later

## 📉 Vg–Id Analysis (Gate Voltage Sweep)

### How to Run

```bash
cd bsim/bsim4_analyzer_dc/run
python run_vgid.py
```

This script automatically performs:

1. SPICE netlist generation  
2. ngspice execution  
3. Numerical data extraction  
4. Linear and logarithmic plotting

### NMOS: $V_g$ – $I_d$ Characteristics (Example)

<img src="https://samizo-aitl.github.io/SemiDevKit/assets/bsim4_analyzer_dc/nmos_vgid.png" width="80%">

- Horizontal axis: gate voltage $V_g$  
- Vertical axis: drain current $I_d$  

From this plot, you can extract:

- Threshold voltage $V_t$  
- Subthreshold region behavior  
- On-current level  
- Gate control capability  
  ($g_m = \partial I_d / \partial V_g$)

What you observed in **TCAD as “channel formation”**  
appears here **directly as V–I characteristics**.

---

### PMOS: $V_g$ – $I_d$ Characteristics

<img src="https://samizo-aitl.github.io/SemiDevKit/assets/bsim4_analyzer_dc/pmos_vgid.png" width="80%">

For PMOS, characteristics are plotted using SPICE polarity conventions.  
Temperature-dependent changes in $|V_t|$ and mobility can also be observed.

## 📊 Vd–Id Analysis (Drain Voltage Sweep)

### How to Run

```bash
cd bsim/bsim4_analyzer_dc/run
python run_vdid.py
```

---

### NMOS: $V_d$ – $I_d$ Characteristics (Example)

<img src="https://samizo-aitl.github.io/SemiDevKit/assets/bsim4_analyzer_dc/nmos_vdid.png" width="80%">

- Horizontal axis: drain voltage $V_d$  
- Vertical axis: drain current $I_d$  

From this plot, you can clearly identify:

- Linear region (low $V_d$)  
- Saturation region  
- Channel-length modulation (output resistance $r_o$)

These are the **operating regions of a MOSFET**,  
clearly revealed by DC analysis.

### PMOS: $V_d$ – $I_d$ Characteristics

<img src="https://samizo-aitl.github.io/SemiDevKit/assets/bsim4_analyzer_dc/pmos_vdid.png" width="80%">

This analysis is also useful for:

- Extracting $I_{d,\mathrm{lin}}$ and $I_{d,\mathrm{sat}}$  
- Comparing short-channel effects

## 🧠 Linking DC Characteristics to Physical Models

The V–I characteristics obtained from DC analysis are **not black boxes**.

| DC Characteristic | Corresponding Physical Factors |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| $V_t$            | Doping concentration, oxide thickness |
| On-current       | Mobility, channel length |
| Saturation       | Velocity saturation, short-channel effects |

All of these are connected through the consistent flow:

> **TCAD → BSIM4 → SPICE**

## 🧪 Why DC Analysis Is So Important

DC analysis is more than just plotting characteristics.

It serves as a **sanity check** to confirm that:

- The model is not broken  
- Parameters are physically reasonable  
- There are no abnormal voltage or temperature dependencies  

AC analysis, CV analysis, and reliability analysis  
**all assume that DC characteristics are correct**.

---

## 📝 Summary

- DC analysis is fundamental to MOSFET understanding  
- $V_g$ – $I_d$ and $V_d$ – $I_d$ must always be checked  
- The meaning of BSIM4 appears directly in V–I characteristics  
- SemiDevKit enables automated and reproducible analysis
