## 🧭 How to Read This Series

- **If you want a physics-first understanding**  
  → 01 → 06 → 07  

- **If you want hands-on ASIC / OpenLane practice**  
  → 12 → 09 → 10 → 11 → 13 → 14  

- **If you want to understand the design philosophy**  
  → 06 → 07 → 14

## 🎯 Core Questions Addressed in This Series

- Why were structural transitions inevitable?  
- Why are EDA tools never “universal”?  
- Why must modern design be approached at the system level?  

All of these questions converge on a single theme:

> **Not “Can we build it?”  
> but “Can we make it *work as a system*?”**

## 🔚 Closing

`01_Semiconductor` serves as a **starting point for viewing semiconductor technology  
not as isolated techniques, but as a coherent design framework**.

It is intended to be read in conjunction with later directories  
covering control, SystemDK, and educational toolchains.
