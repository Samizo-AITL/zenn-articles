## 🎯 Core Questions Addressed

- Why were structural transitions inevitable?  
- Why are EDA tools never universal?  
- Why must modern design be approached at the system level?  

> **Not “Can we build it?”  
> but “Can we make it work as a system?”**

## 🔚 Closing

`01_Semiconductor` is the **entry point for understanding semiconductor technology  
as a coherent design framework rather than isolated techniques**.
