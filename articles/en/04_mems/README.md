# 🧬 04_mems / MEMS Analysis & Analog Physics — Article Index

In this directory,  
**MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems)** are examined  
*prior to control and software considerations*,  
with a focus on understanding the **analog physics, structure, behavior, and inherent limits**.

---

## 📘 Overview & Introduction

- [01 MEMS Analysis Overview](./01_mems-ana_overview.md)

> MEMS are redefined  
> not as “small machines,”  
> but as **continuous-time analog physical systems**.

---

## 🧪 Demos & Intuitive Understanding

- [02 MEMS Analysis Demo](./02_mems-ana_demo.md)

> Before equations and models,  
> **develop intuition for behavior, sensitivity, and nonlinearity**.

---

## 🧠 Core Theory & Essentials

- [03 MEMS Analysis Core Theory](./03_mems-ana_core.md)

> The essence of MEMS design lies in  
> **structure, materials, and boundary conditions**,  
> while downstream control serves only as compensation.

## 🧭 Positioning of This Directory

- **04_mems**:
  - Physics, structure, and materials take precedence
  - A domain where discrete control (FSM) and higher-level logic **cannot intrude**
- A concrete, physical extension of **03_hardware**
- A conceptual bridge toward **05_inkjet**

> **MEMS are not merely “control targets”;  
> they must first be understood as physical systems.**
