## 🧭 Introduction

FreeCAD is widely known as a *parametric CAD* system.  
However, what is far less known is that:

> **Using only Python code,  
> FreeCAD can generate surprisingly rich geometric shapes**

—without using:

- Sketches  
- Constraints  
- Part Design  
- Or almost any GUI operation  

In this article, we introduce **pure code-driven solid geometry** created with:

- No sketches  
- No Part Design  
- Nearly zero GUI interaction

## 👀 First, Look at the Final Results

### Function-defined Loft + Twisted Solid

![function_loft](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Samizo-AITL/qiita-articles/main/assets/images/06_1.png)

This solid is generated by:

- Defining the radius as a **function r(z)**  
- Modulating the cross-section using **periodic functions**  
- Stacking profiles along the z-axis via **Loft**  
- Applying an additional **Twist** transformation  

All of this is done **entirely in Python code**.

No sketches. No constraints.

## 🌀 Another Example: A Branched Spiral Solid

Next is a shape that is even more hostile to GUI-based modeling.

This model is constructed by:

- Generating spatial curves (spirals) in code  
- Defining cross-sections via functions  
- Introducing **phase jumps** to create branches  
- Converting the result into a solid using Sweep / Loft-like logic  

Because the geometric properties change mid-way,  
this type of model is notoriously fragile in history-based GUI CAD.

## 🔍 What Is the Key Point?

The important point is **not** that the shapes look exotic.

### Geometry as the Result of Rules

In these examples:

- Dimensions  
- Wave amplitude  
- Twist magnitude  
- Branch locations  

are all defined as **variables and functions in Python**.

In other words:

> Geometry is **not** the result of manual operations  
> but the **result of executing rules**

## ⚔️ The Fundamental Difference from GUI CAD

Trying to create the same shapes in GUI CAD typically results in:

- Too many sketches  
- Constraint breakage  
- Loss of understanding of *why* the shape exists  

In contrast, with code-based design:

```python
def r(z):
    return base + amp * math.sin(freq * z)
```

The **design intent itself** is preserved as code.

Change a parameter → re-run → new geometry.

## 🧰 Practical Benefits in Real Work

This approach is not just for artistic modeling.

It is highly effective for:

- Special-purpose shafts  
- Mixing or agitation geometries  
- Cooling fins  
- Experimental fixtures  
- Parametric shape exploration  

Because everything is code-based:

- Git diff tracking works naturally  
- Reasons for design changes remain visible  
- Derivative designs are easy to generate  

---

## 🧾 Summary

FreeCAD can be used not only as:

- A tool for drawing sketches  

but also as:

- **A geometric engine that executes rules**

There is no need to reject GUI workflows.  
However, simply adding the option to:

> **Describe shape-generation rules in code**

dramatically expands how CAD can be used.
