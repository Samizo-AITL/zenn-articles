# 06_mechanical / Mechanical Design · CAD to Code — Article Index

In this directory,  
**Mechanical Design** is detached from traditional GUI-centric CAD workflows and extended toward  
**code-based reproducibility, diff-driven review, and structurally defined design**.

---

## 🖥 From GUI to Code

- [01 From GUI CAD to Code](./01_gui-cad-to-code.md)

> Instead of “drawing” shapes,  
> adopt the mindset of **defining structure**.

---

## 📐 Philosophy and Position of FreeCAD

- [02 What Is FreeCAD?](./02_what-is-freecad.md)

> FreeCAD is not merely a CAD tool,  
> but a **geometry description engine**.

---

## 🧠 Design Thinking Through Code

- [03 Code-Based Design with FreeCAD](./03_freecad_code_design.md)
- [04 Part Design Driven by Code](./04_part_design_with_code.md)

> By fixing dimensions, constraints, and intent in code,  
> **design stability is dramatically improved**.

---

## 🔍 Design Diffs and History Management

- [05 Design Management via Git Diff](./05_git_diff_code_design.md)

> Design reviews are conducted  
> not on drawings, but on **diffs**.

---

## 🧩 Geometry Representation and Reuse

- [06 FreeCAD Geometry Representation Showcase](./06_geometric_showcase_freecad.md)

> Geometry is not something to merely display,  
> but **a reusable component**.

---

## 🧱 Common Code Structure · Final Form

- [07 Full Code Common Structure (Final)](./07_full_code_common_structure.md)

> Mechanical design is  
> **structured at the same level as software**.

## 🧭 Positioning of This Directory

- **06_mechanical**:
  - A layer that fixes physical geometry through code  
  - Structural definition prior to MEMS and inkjet systems
- The foundation for **03_hardware / 04_mems / 05_inkjet**
- The **Physical Definition Layer** in AITL

> **If mechanical design remains ambiguous,  
> neither control nor intelligence built on top of it can stand.**
