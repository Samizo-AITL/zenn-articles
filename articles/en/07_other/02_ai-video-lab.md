# 🎞️ 【Video:02】Why I Tested AI Video as a Teaching Medium — and Chose to Walk Away
topics: ["ai", "education", "design", "prompt", "runway"]

## 🧾 Conclusion First

**AI-generated video is not suitable as the main medium for educational or technical materials.**

This is not an impression or a gut feeling.  
It is a **design decision** made after actually using the tools,  
designing prompts, generating outputs, storing results,  
and evaluating them from an educational standpoint.

## 🔍 Why I Decided to Test It

Generative AI is already practical in areas such as:

- Text generation  
- Diagram assistance  
- Code skeleton generation  

in education and technical fields.

So the natural next question was:

> **Can AI-generated video be used for teaching?**

If video could be effective for lecture introductions,  
technical presentations, or research explanations,  
it would be worth adopting.

To answer this, I created a **dedicated verification repository**  
and tested it in practice.

## 🧪 What I Actually Did

The verification followed these principles:

- Prompts managed in Markdown  
- Reproducibility as the top priority  
- Comparison of Image → Video and Text → Video  
- Generated outputs stored on GitHub  
- Evaluation based on “usable or dangerous” for educational use  

The key question was not  
**“Can it generate something?”**  
but  
**“Does it remain as a design asset?”**

## 🧠 What I Learned Technically

### ① Output Is Not Stable

- Results fluctuate even with identical prompts  
- Not suitable for comparison or verification  

### ② Accuracy Cannot Be Guaranteed

- Text, symbols, and structures easily break  
- “Looking right” overrides being correct  

### ③ Credit-Based Systems Conflict with Verification

- Failures still consume credits  
- Trial-and-error is psychologically discouraged  

---

## 🚫 The Critical Problem for Educational Use

In educational and technical materials, the top priority is:

> **Do not mislead.**

AI video excels at:

- Atmosphere  
- Immersion  
- Visual impact  

But it is **not a medium for accurately conveying**:

- Mathematical expressions  
- Structural relationships  
- Causal chains  

The conclusion was clear:

> **AI video can never be more than a “preface,”  
> not an explanation.**

---

## 🧭 Final Policy Decision

### Restrict AI Video to “Meaning-Free” Use Cases

- Lecture openings  
- Presentation introductions  
- Section transitions  

The safety condition is simple:  
**do not put information into the video.**

---

## ❌ What I Decided Not to Use It For

- Video explanations of equations  
- Animated representations of technical structures  
- Any explanation requiring accuracy  

When in doubt,  
**do not use it.**

---

## 🧱 Why Write About “Walking Away”

Discussions around generative AI tend to focus on:

- What was achieved  
- How impressive it looks  

But in real design work:

> **The reasons for deciding not to use something  
> are often the most valuable assets.**

This verification clarified:

- The limitations of AI video  
- The boundaries required in educational design  
- Criteria for choosing the right battlefield

## 📂 Verification Logs and Generated Evidence

This article is based on **actual repositories and generated videos**.

### Verification Repository
- GitHub: **AI Video Lab**  
  👉 [https://github.com/samizo-aitl/ai-video-lab](https://github.com/samizo-aitl/ai-video-lab)

This repository includes:
- Reproducible prompt designs (`prompts/`)  
- Generation workflows (`workflows/`)  
- Failure cases and evaluation notes (`notes/`)  
- Generated samples (`samples/`)  

### Generated Sample Video
- Reference video (MP4, 5s, Image → Video)  
  👉 [https://github.com/samizo-aitl/ai-video-lab/blob/main/samples/output/abstract_lab_01.mp4](https://github.com/samizo-aitl/ai-video-lab/blob/main/samples/output/abstract_lab_01.mp4)

- Playable directly on GitHub  
- An **intentionally meaningless abstract video** for educational introductions

## 🧾 Summary

- AI video can be generated  
- But it should not be the core of educational material  
- Choosing not to use it is not a failure  
- It is a **design outcome**

What matters in the age of generative AI is not:

> what we can use  

but rather:

> **where we draw the line, and how clearly we can explain it.**
