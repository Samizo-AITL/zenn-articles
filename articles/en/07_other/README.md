# 📊 07_other / Supporting Technologies, Visualization, and Analytics

This directory collects **supporting technologies** that are not part of the AITL  
(Architecture for Integrated Technology Logic) core itself,  
but are **critically important for design, understanding, and verification**.

These topics function as stabilizers for thinking, communication, and feedback.

## 🎞 Visualization & Animation

- [01 AITL Animation Demos & Visualization](./01_aitl-animation-demos-visualization.md)

> A design that cannot be understood  
> will eventually fail in implementation.  
> **Visualization is a debugging tool for thinking.**

---

## 🎥 AI Video & Experimental Environments

- [02 AI Video Lab](./02_ai-video-lab.md)

> A structure that cannot be explained  
> has not yet been designed.  
> **Video is a compressed representation of structural understanding.**

---

## 📊 Access Analytics & Feedback

- [03 GA4 Analytics Usage](./03_ga4_analytics.md)

> Design and dissemination alike  
> **cannot be improved if they are not observable**.

## 🧭 Positioning of This Directory

- **07_other**:
  - A supporting layer for the main system (01–06)
  - Stabilization of understanding through visualization, explanation, and analysis
- The **Observation / Feedback Layer** in AITL
- A buffer zone that prevents separation between technology and communication

> **Intelligence can only grow  
> within the range that can be observed.**
